{"doc_id": 291, "doc": {"answer": 3, "question": "You are studying resistance mechanisms of Puccinia sorghi to the Delaro fungicide. To accomplish this, you grow a sample in a greenhouse of sweet corn and allow it to grow before you apply the Delaro to the greenhouse at 50% of the recommended concentration.
